### About
This is the private-events project for the Odin Project's curriculum, adapted with the premise of being a board gaming social app.

>You want to build a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).

### Features
* Hand-rolled authentication
* Integration of Moderna Bootstrap template
* Pagination

### Live site
